# Colette-Bot:
The very old code for Colette Bot. Used to use this back in 2020-2021.

# General idea:

I always loved Discord bots. They make my life easier, but some bots limit the number of features to premium, which I don't like. Colette Bot was just the beginning of that. I wanted more information packed into a single embed while also storing all the data locally, somewhere I can trust.

Colette Bot underwent many revisions. I cannot even begin to count how many times I had to rewrite the code. My fellow developer and friend, Dest, helped me code many different parts of the bot. We used to use a package called aoi.js for this. Looking back, it was one of the worst packages I have used. With every rewrite, new features were added and jam-packed with them. I loved working on this bot every so often.

# Why Archive?

I published the archive code as so many changes have been introduced. Gears, Power 11, changes to the API, outdated packages, etc. It would benifit if others could see and use this code to improve or get inspried. I still use parts of this code (that's at least updated) for my current bots.
